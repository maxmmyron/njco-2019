                                    Synthetic plastics, the material that makes up microplastics, were originally designed to unbound humans from using only what nature supplied.

                                <p class="info-text">
                                    The first synthetic polymers were surprisingly designed as a substitute for the ivory from animals tusks used in billiard balls. A $10,000 reward from a New York firm was eventually granted to John Wesley Hyatt for making such a substance; the first in
                                    a class of synthetic polymers known as celluloids. He had figured out a method for treating cellulose, the primary component of plant cell walls, with a waxy, transparent substance called Camphor, which was found in
                                    evergreen trees in Asia. This process produced a synthetic polymer that could be easily molded and reshaped, and Hyatt's introduction of this, along with his many other accomplishments in the field of plastics (including
                                    developing an injection molding press) helped to kickstart a plastic revolution.

                                    The first fully synthetic plastic (which contained no naturally occuring monomers) that could easily be commercialized was developed in 1907 by Leo Baekeland <sub>(fig. 1)</sub>. Commercially sold under the name Bakelite,
                                    it was a tough, durable plastic that was particularly useful for its non conductivity, a property that was sought after for many early electronics to prevent shortages. This made it a fantastic casing material in radios,
                                    early telephones, and televisions <sub>(fig. 2)</sub>. It also served a purpose as a clean material in practical products, like jewelry boxes and whistles.

                                    Synthetic plastics are large groupings of polymers which themselves are large chains of monomers. These monomers are easily repeating molecules. These polymers form substances that can easily be shaped and formed into hard structures. Many plastics, due
                                    to this critical polymer-based structure, are regular in order. Known as crystallinity <sub>(fig. 3)</sub>, plastics with a high crystallinity are more resistant to chemical and mechanical
                                    wear because of this regularity, while plastics with a lower crystallinity are less resistant to chemical and mechanical wear.
                                </p>
                                <p class="info-text">
                                    Based on the length and variations on this basic polymer structure, plastics can have wildly varying properties. A primary example is the difference between thermoplastics and thermosets, where the former has few crosslinking polymers, while thermosets
                                    have many crosslinking polymers that form a large 3D network of polymers. This difference means that thermoplastics can be melted and reshaped, however thermosets only set one and stay in that form, often decomposing
                                    before being able to be melted again.
                                </p>

                                    The most common type of plastics are polyethylene, which derive from petrochemicals (products from petroleum). Polyethylenes are composed mainly of ethylenes, hydrocarbons that are defined by their double-double carbon bonds. Generally speaking, this
                                    monomer is written as H<sub>2</sub>C=CH<sub>2</sub>. Polyethylene can be seen most commonly in two variants- high density polyethylene (HDPE) and low density polyethylene (LDPE).
                                    These two plastics are so different because LDPE tends to branch off 2% more than its high density counterpart. This branching gives LDPE lower intermolecular forces, in turn allowing it to have a bigger flex than HDPE
                                    and less overall resistance to wear. HDPE, on the other hand, has a much higher resistance to flex and degradation because it branches less, meaning the polymers in HPDE are more tightly packed.

                                    Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) is a food safe plastic defined by its polymerization of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>Cl, food-safe quality, and strength. Because the polymers of PVC are strong and linear, the intermolecular forces
                                    are much higher, giving PVC a high density, much higher than that of both HDPE and LDPE.

                                    Generally speaking, plastics are made through a process known as polymerization, in which monomers link together to form polymers. This process can be executed in two ways. One method is step-growth polymerization, in where polymers form by momers linking
                                    in pairs of two, three, and longer to eventually join to form polymers, and through chain-growth polymerization, in where monomers link together one by one, like linking a metal chain together one link at a time.

                                    Chain-growth Polymerization: polymerization where monomers only add onto the active sides (normally the ends) of a polymer one at a time, like how a steel chain grows one link at a time. In this process, a "seed" monomer acts as a starting point for other
                                    monomers to latch onto and grow off of. Many chain-growth polymerization process involve unsaturated hydrocarbons, which are hydrocarbons with double or even triple bonds between adjacent carbon bonds. Ethylene, for
                                    example, is an unsaturated hydrocarbon, and has a double bond between its two carbon atoms: H<sub>2</sub>C=CH<sub>2</sub>

                                    Both Step-growth and chain-growth polymerization can be accomplished through two main processes.
                                    <br /><br /> Addition polymerization begins with a catalyst, like peroxide R<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> ("R" in molecules is a stand-in for the rest of the molecule, usually a chain of hydro carbons, or the main link
                                    of the polymer chain.). The two oxygen atoms share a strong bond, which is integral to the beginning of addition polymerization. For simplicity this peroxide can be rewritten as RO-OR.
                                    <br />
                                </p>
                                <p class="info-text">
                                    In the presence of light, heat, or other energies, the strong bond can break and give off two molecules: RO· and RO· (this is also the reason that hydrogen peroxide is often stored in an opaque container, otherwise it would decompose in the presence of
                                    light energy!). These molecules are known as free radicals, and because of their unbonded electron, are extremely reactive and unstable. For the purpose of addition polymerization, they can be called initiators, because
                                    they start reactions. The initiator, when in the presence of a monomer like ethylene bond together and break the double bond that holds the monomer together, and forms two single bonds:
                                    <br /> RO· + H<sub>2</sub>C=CH<sub>2</sub> &nbsp;⟶&nbsp; ROCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>·
                                    <br /><br /> This process can repeat for any number of monomers, as they add onto the initial RO-M· (M being a monomer, RO being the initiator.)
                                    <br /><br /> This process can end once another free radical attaches to the reactive end of the polymer, which creates one final single bond and closes off the reaction, completing the polymerization process.
                                    <br /><br /> Polycondensation, on the other hand, is the process in which polymers form with a byproduct, such as water or an alcohol. This process involves a few monomers and concepts:

                                    Microplastics can be divided into two categories: primary and secondary. Primary microplastics are formed at their small size, like microbeads in exfoliants or plastic beads used in packaging. A majority of these microplastics can make their way into
                                    the ocean by going down the drain, in cases with exfoliants and even toothpastes with microbeads in them. These primary microplastics make their way into the environment through a multitude of ways: throwing plastics
                                    out instead of recycling them, littering packaging materials, and pouring them down the drain.

                                    Secondary microplastics have gone through a weathering process before they become what they are. Secondary microplastics can often start out as plastic bottles, bags, or any other plastic products. Some of the plastics break down due to persistent physical
                                    weathering like waves and storms, but many of them can break down due to the sun itself.

                                    The ultraviolet rays emitted by the sun have enough energy to slowly break down plastics. As aforementioned in the creation of plastics sunlight energy has enough energy to break the bonds in peroxides to form free radicals that initiate plastic creations,
                                    and it is the same sunlight that has the ability to break the bonds in plastics. While UV rays themselves can completely break down a pure plastic, the impurities and residues of catalysis in the initial plastic creation
                                    process can help with that. The absorption of energy by these impurities can cause the breakdown of critical double bonds in the plastics, which can lead to very brittle structures. These brittle plastics can be torn
                                    apart much easier by weathering processes, forming many microplastics.

                                    Bisphenol A (commonly referred to as BPA) is a compound often used in the synthesis of polycarbonate (through polycondensation, in fact). BPA has a chemical structure similar to that of estrogen, making it an endocrine disruptor. This means that it has
                                    the ability to disrupt the body's hormones, and a Chinese study from a hormonal steroid responsible for the development of female characteristics in the human body during puberty. Studies show that BPA has the ability
                                    to lower the amount of testosterone, a hormone primarily found in men that gives male characteristics to a person. High, long exposure doses to BPA are also linked to an increase in fertility problems, and one study
                                    found that BPA can lead to coronary heart disease, agenia, and heart attacks, among others.

                                    It isn’t just BPA that can cause stunted child development, but the mere presence of microplastics in the placenta, as one study found, can have adverse effects on the growth of a child. In fact, all young children are at a higher danger to the effects
                                    of microplastics, because they have weaker immune systems, and because microplastics are almost like pollution mops, picking up carcinogens and potentially diseases.

                                    Microplastics can get in the digestive system of many microorganisms and potentially kill or starve them. Likewise, because microplastics are so small, they can easily be mistaken for food by many organisms, or eaten inadvertently by organisms that don't
                                    realize it is there. Microplastics can make their way into cattle through eating the plants fed fertilizer made up of biosolids from water treatment plants (many of which capture as many as 80% of the microplastics
                                    sent through them, as shown in a Danish study). These microplastics can be found in the plants that we eat too, since cattle crops aren't the only crops fertilized with our own feces. They can be found in fish, since
                                    some microscopic microplastics can be eaten by zooplankton, which are eaten by small fish, crustaceans, and shellfish, many of which end up caught by us. In fact, a person who regularly eats mussel may consume up to
                                    11 thousand microplastics a year.

                                    Many microplastics can bind to persistent organic pollutants (POPs), some of which are carcinogens, toxins, and industrial waste. these POPs don't degrade in the environment, and the microplastics ability to soak up these pollutants, sometimes as much
                                    as one million times the usual background levels, can lead to several adverse effects in those that intake the microplastics accidentally. Likewise, they can carry carcinogens and deadly diseases, which can affect the

                                    A lot of microplastic pollution is able to seep into the ground after being broken down in landfills. Microplastics in the soil can lead to stunted growth of both plants and animals. For example, worms’ diets and burrowing patterns can be altered due
                                    to an increase in microplastic concentrations in soils.

                                    Due to its physical and chemical properties, plastic can continue breaking down to a size so small that they become naked to the human eye. Airborne microplastics are more prevalent indoors rather than outdoors because of the higher concentration of synthetic-made
                                    items inside like clothes and furniture. When these plastics are inhaled, they can either get stuck in the lung muscles where it is very difficult to remove them, or they can enter the bloodstream after entering the
                                    lungs.

                                    The amount of sources of microplastics that lead into the ocean are almost unlimited. Plastics can enter bodies of water from landfills, sewage dumps, flushing them down the drain, litter, and more. But no matter what, if these plastic reach the oceans,
                                    they will break down into microplastics. 275 thousand metric tons of microplastics enter global waterways every year and that average only keeps rising. Not only are microplastics in the ocean, but they are in water
                                    from the tap as well. Most filtration facilities cannot purify their water of microplastics because of their small size. Due to this, studies have shown that 83 percent of tap water samples contained plastics.

                                    The current state of microplastics can be found in three main categories: current levels, current locations, and current sources.
                                    <ol style="padding-left:70px">
                                        <li>
                                            Current levels:<br><br /> An estimation by Environmental Research Levels predicts that there are between 93 to 236 thousand tons of microplastics in the oceans, which was significantly higher than previous estimates
                                            done.
                                            <br /><br /> In fact, according to a report by the World Economic Forum in 2016, if preventive measures are not taken, then by 2050 the total amount of plastic in the oceans alone could outweigh all of the fish
                                            in the oceans, pound for pound.

                                            Current sources:<br /><br /> Microplastics come from primary and secondary sources, the former of which often end up in rivers and oceans, and the latter of which beginning in landfills or oceans and breaking
                                            down into microplastics in the ground or oceans.
                                            <br /><br /> In the United States, it is estimated that eight billion microplastic beads enter the oceans every day, according to a study by Environmental Science and & Technology
                                            <br /><br /> Rivers are often a major source of plastic pollution into the oceans. Because many civilizations live by rivers, they have become a conveyor belt for the transportation of plastics and microplastics.
                                            In fact, in a report by Environmental Science and Technology, 88%-95% of all plastic runoff into the ocean comes from 10 rivers around the globe.
                                            <br /><br /> A major source of microplastic and plastic pollution is, ironically, from waste management. Because only about a fifth of plastic is every recycled in a year, the other eighty percent ends up in
                                            landfills, where wind can blow it away, UV exposure and weathering break it down, and natural weather carry it away into the surrounding environment.
                                            <br /><br /> A 2015 study found that approximately 60% of mismanaged plastic waste with a high risk of ending up in the surrounding environment was located in East Asia. The exponential industrialization of
                                            these countries combined with waste management in these countries has led to a sharp increase of waste mismanagement in recent years.

                                        <br />
                                        <li>
                                            Current locations:<br /><br /> Many microplastics are situated in large, rotating patches of water in the oceans known as gyres. Because many microplastics are easily swept into rivers and channeled into the
                                            oceans, many microplastics end up in these gyres. There are five gyres around the world: two in the Atlantic, two in the Pacific, and one in the Indian Ocean. These gyres exist due to the Coriolis effect, an
                                            effect that arises between the air, water, and spinning earth.
                                            <br /><br /> Due to their weight, many microplastics easily follow ocean currents and can accumulate on coastlines. Often times, microplastics can get trapped in large bays and seas due to their calmer waves,
                                            and accumulate in their oceans and coastlines.
                                            <br /><br /> A study performed by the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research (AWI) found that up to 12,000 microplastics exist per liter of sea ice, and found the highest concentrations in arctic
                                            sea ice. One of the teams’ concern was, with rising ocean temperatures due to global warming, could lead to large amounts of microplastics being released into the ocean.

                                    Following the 2016 discover of a bacterium with the ability to breakdown PET, researchers at a Japanese waste dump accidentally made the enzyme in the bacterium responsible for breaking down the plastic, called PETase, stronger. This mutated PETase has
                                    the ability to break down PET in a couple of days, as compared to the near half a millennium it would normally take. The bacterium, Ideonella sakaiensis, breaks down PET through hydrolysis, which is a chemical process
                                    in which the bonds of a chemical are broken with water. The breakdown of PET this way, followed by another reaction with the reaction intermediates (2-Hydroxyethyl terephthalic acid), leads to building blocks that the
                                    bacterium uses to grow.

                                    However, beyond both governmental and scientific efforts, the strongest effect that we can take on preserving the oceans is a change in mentality. A hundred years of plastic use has ingrained it in our society as a wonderful technology that can do nearly
                                    anything other things can't, however it has become synonymous with single-use products like plastic straws, utensils, bags, and disposable cameras. The greatest course of action to take is to stop thinking of plastics
                                    as so disposable.

                                    A true solution to microplastics requires an international effort by politicians, scientists, and citizens in order to truly achieve a plastic pollution-free environment in the future. Politicians regulating single use plastics or condoning the use of
                                    more recyclable alternatives and increasing waste management infrastructure, scientists figuring out more biodegradable alternatives and solutions to clean up the mess we have, and citizens taking into their own hands
                                    the recycling of plastics. The state of plastic pollution we are in is a result of gross negligence, a byproduct of the human need to innovate faster than we can keep up with. However, as humans, we can bound back,
                                    and figure out solutions to the problems we invent.
